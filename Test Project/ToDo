notes to self:
room goes out at all edges in issac, maybe use like 75degree angle.


LINQ seems like cool shit but seems useless for 2d arrays.


look int OnDrawGizmos

look into celular atomita and marching squares.


look up structs, know what the difrence is.

look up Dictionary in c#

look up indexers in c# seems useful for wepon wheel

look up math.Sign

look up bresenhams line algorithm

figure out what a mesh filter and a mesh renderer are.


to make a laser just make a really long bullet.

figure out what the diference between a trigger and a colider is.

forward.normalized might fix the momentium thing

laser should have rotation lock for player

Goals:

lasers

maybe networking





you should be able to pass in a value for the speed and damage too a bullet and with that value the bullet should be able to set an ofset and contol min and max bounds.



problems:
bullets dont have momentum of the gun they are shot from- fixed! kinda broke again

camera should "clamp" to the edges of rooms if you move to close to the edge.

refacter classes into one script maybe?? 



make sure all damage and health mecanics are tied to phisics frame rate. currently lasers are tied to the framerate to do their ticks of damage. im also not sure fire rate is not framerate dependent 


when the laser shooter shoots his laser he is only paralized for the begining of the shot not until the laser disapears.

if you get hit (by another rb) then try to shoot your laser you just end up spinning around.

there is a rendering error with enemy lasers now that I Fixed the walls

movement is completely broke, it gets floaty with the forces


Shit I will need latter: player transfer between scenes:

https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/how-to-transfer-player-data-between-scenes.443347/


lasers should destroy bullets.

for fun now that school has started Im going to start logging how much time im working on this.

0. 10-25 hours
1.~2:30:00
2. 1:41:46
3. 1:34:58






stuff for the speach

spent like two hours trying to have the properties of the projectile determined by the gun that made it then realized that should be something the bullet handles itself.








--------------------------------------------------------------procedural generation plan:


make cells
cellular atomita cells
make a door along each wall of the border.
make sure all walls are conected in some way. probs by drawing a line to a random point int the room maybe have difrent pathing to get to the points so it is not just a strait wall every time.

the walls at the borders should be indestructable.

when you click on a room it generates a new room of a bounded random size, unless the new room already boarders an existing room, then it must be big enough to not intersect or if it does line up it should use the previously unused door
every room should have a small chance to spawn a door to the next level THIS DOES NOT NECCESSARLY NEED TO BE IN THE MAIN AREA, if it is cut off it can just be remade in another room.

at the start of the next floor maybe have a boss?



maybe only have the walls be visable if they are exposed ie there is a 1 in their von nomin nabhorhood.



-------------------------------------------- Ideas for enemy movement paterns:--------------------------------

Teleporting:
teleporting enemies would engage when the player enters a certin radius, or when they are shot the first time. after this they will relentlessly prasue the player


	-right behind you and then dellay and then laser.

	-teleport every second or two to a random position around the player.


normal: 
	-move tword player but also tries to dodge bullets with sometype of triger or collider.
	a melee varient of this would be nice.





















///----------------------------------------------praposal-------------------------------------------------------


I am proposing to make a top down shooter with the following features:

1. A player that can fire at least two distinct projectile types. 
	A.Possible Projectile types include:
		medium speed bullets fired rapidly.
		a  beam wepon that can penetrate enemies.
			it will extend to the length of the room.
			there is a delay before firing during which time the player is not able to move.
			perhaps taking enough damage will prevent the laser from firing, and unparalize the player early.
			perhaps during the charge up there is a sighting laser


2. A HUD that at the minimum desplays the players health.

3. At least X distinct enemies with diffrent combinations of movement and shooting paterns.
	A. possible enemies include:
		A Stationary turret that shoots:
			bullets in a random direction.
			bullets at the player.
			4 bullets, one in each of the cardinal directions.
			4 bullets, one in each of the primary intercardinal directions.
			8 bullets, one in each of the cardinal directions and one in the primary intercardinal directions.
			8 bullets, one in each of the secondary intercardinal directions.
			16 bullets, one in each direction.

			in the fashion of any turret listed above, but also rotates.

			in the fashion of any turret listed above, but instead fires a beam weapon.



		A mobile enemy that moves directly towards the player:
			and shoots bullets.
			and shoots bullets but also moves to strafe the player once close enough.
			doesn't shoot, and detenates on impact with the player dealing high damage.
			and detenates on impact with the player dealing high damage.
			and shoots bullets, and has a front facing shield that blocks a limited number of bullets.
		

		A mobile enemy that moves in a zig-zag twords the player moving at 45 degrees reletive to the player and alterneates every second or two:
			and does anything the enemy above does.
			does not face the player but has an indistructable shield.



		



4. at least one boss with at least 2 phases that a player can face at the end of a floor.

4. A main menu that you can exit to the desktop from or start a game.

5. A pickup system that lets the player improve their character.
	A. Possible pickups include:
		Increasing character health.
		Increasing beam Damage.
		Increasing bullet Damage.
		Increasing bullet fire rate.
		Increasing player movement speed.
		Increasing beam weapon diamater.
		Increasing bullet size.
		increasing bullet movement speed.
		increasing bullet range. (time before despawn)
		Decreasing the time the player is paralized before firing thier beam weapon.
		Decreasing the delay before player can fire their beam weapon.
		Decreasing player size (making it easyer to dodge).

	All pickups will have caps so that the players stats do not become to high. This is not just a balance issue as something like too high a movement speed could make the game very unfun.


6. A dungen based on procedural generation that generates rooms with distructable walls that conect together and eventually lead to a boss room.
	The dungeon will consist of mutliple rooms of random size.
	Each room will consist of many cube walls that will be destructable with the expception of the last layer of wall, which will be indestructable.
	their will be one or more door out of each room, if this results in a door adjacent to an existing room then the rooms will be connected.
	each door can only be opened once the room's enemy
