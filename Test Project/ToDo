notes to self:
room goes out at all edges in issac, maybe use like 75degree angle.

work on the cave generation algarithm, there are some notes on how a person might change it at the end of the first video in the series.

LINQ seems like cool shit but seems useless for 2d arrays.


look int OnDrawGizmos

look into celular atomita and marching squares.

an outline edge is two verticies which share exactly one triangle.


look up structs, know what the difrence is.

look up Dictionary in c#

look up indexers in c# seems useful for wepon wheel

look up math.Sign

look up bresenhams line algorithm

figure out what a mesh filter and a mesh renderer are.


Goals:




problems:
bullets dont have momentum of the gun they are shot from- fixed! kinda broke again

camera should "clamp" to the edges of rooms if you move to close to the edge.

refacter classes into one script maybe?? c# is weird you can have nested public classes.




Shit I will need latter: player transfer between scenes:
